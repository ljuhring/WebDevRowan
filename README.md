What are the steps you followed ?

Saved Zipped folder to a folder I created on my desktop. All files were inside.

Which tutorial did you follow ?
I found a tutorial on youtube. I saw that most of the tutorials has a "clone" button but my git hub I could not find it. I also saw you can use git command line but the copying the zip file to desktop seemed the easiest. Although I'm unsure if this method for syncronization between the two.
